        question: "Are the tickets limited in availability?",

        answer:
          "To register the class, you need to fill out the schools@devfest bari 2024 form. The form is an expression of interest that allows us to have a better view of the classes that want to participate. However, it is necessary that each student individually gets a ticket to participate. Seats are limited, so we recommend doing it as soon as possible.",

      {
        question:
          "I am a high school student, my class is not registered to attend the DevFest but I still want to participate independently, how can I participate?",

      },
      {
        question: "What does the school ticket include?",
        answer:
          "The school ticket allows access to the entire event area and participation in all tracks and workshops. It also grants priority access to the student track, specifically designed for high school students/recent graduates. The track will last half a morning as it is designed to cover school hours. For the same reason, the school ticket does not include the lunch box.",
